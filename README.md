# CHLOM™ - Phase 2 Governed Registry

**Compliance Hybrid Licensing and Ownership Model** is CrownThrive's governed rights and institutional operating system for **Rights, Rules, Roles, Revenue, Records, and Remedies**.

> **Status:** Phase 2 foundation / pre-alpha. This public repository documents public-safe architecture, formal research, schemas and operating registries. It does not represent a live public blockchain, token, DAO, autonomous legal authority, production oracle network or deployed CHLOM mainnet.

## Production-first doctrine
CHLOM is being rebuilt first as a cloud-first, API-first, event-driven, multi-tenant and human-governed platform. The objective is to govern assets, rights, policies, actors, revenue, evidence, agreements, corrections and remedies consistently across CrownThrive before optional decentralized settlement is introduced.

## Six canonical functions
1. **Rights** - assets, versions, provenance, authority, permissions and restrictions.
2. **Rules** - policies, conditions, eligibility, risk and approval requirements.
3. **Roles** - organizations, actors, credentials, delegated authority and separation of duties.
4. **Revenue** - fees, allocations, royalties, commissions, holds, adjustments and reconciliation.
5. **Records** - DAIL events, evidence references, approvals, versions, agreements and audit history.
6. **Remedies** - disputes, holds, corrections, suspensions, revocations, appeals and restoration.

## Canonical corrections
- **DLA** = Dynamic Licensing Asset.
- **DAIL** = Decentralized Autonomous Information Ledger.
- Historical **Decentralized Licensing Authority** responsibilities move to Licensing Stewardship / Issuer Authority.
- Historical DAL meanings are split among DAIL, Case Management, Identity/Attestations, and Revenue Allocation.

## PentaFabric Generation 61

PentaFabric™ is the controlled-test orchestration layer now being integrated across CHLOM, the Cultural Imprint Engine, the Convergent Ecosystem, ThriveBase, DAIL, CrownLytics, and the CrownThrive Autonomous Software Factory.

The public nomenclature is:

`PentaFabric -> PentaAgentic -> PentaMesh/PentaEdge -> PentaJobs/PentaCrons -> Software Factory -> PentaSpecter/PentaSecure -> PentaVault/DAIL/Continuity`

`prenrafrabic` is preserved as a founder-provided alias of the stable `PentaFabric` identity, not as a second runtime object.

Generation 61 contains ten bounded specialist agents for maintenance, security, routing, edge governance, proprietary custody, jobs, schedules, release packaging, independent verification, and wave continuity. D3 remains human-reserved; no Penta component inherits money-movement, rights-grant, provider-write, or self-approval authority.

The proprietary algorithm implementations remain Vault-controlled. This repository exposes only public-safe contracts, IDs, DIDs, versions, architecture and digests by reference. See `docs/architecture/PENTA_FABRIC.md` and `registry/penta/penta-fabric.v1.json`.

## Public / private boundary
The source recovery package classifies major CHLOM materials as internal or restricted. This public repository therefore stores source metadata and reconciled public-safe abstractions, not confidential documents, raw evidence, secrets, Fingerprint implementation details, proprietary Penta algorithm bodies or private economic logic.

## Validation
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/validate_registry.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

See `docs/architecture/SOURCE_RECONCILIATION.md` for authority and conflict rules.
